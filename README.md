# Amazon Bedrock Parte 1.
Amazon Bedrock is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to facilitate the development of Generative AI applications.

Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) plays a critical role in Amazon Bedrock, enabling developers to create applications with breakthrough capabilities that were previously impossible.
But what is generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos and music, and helps us innovate. Like all artificial intelligence, this one works with machine learning or ML models. However, Generative AI is powered by very, very large models that are pre-trained on large collections of data and are known as base models or fundamental models (FM). Recent advances in machine learning have led to the emergence of fundamental models containing billions of parameters or variables.
Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) have been largely driven by processors.
Within Amazon Web Services (AWS), unprecedented computing power is offered. Among the main ones are the Trainium2 and Graviton4 processors, developed for machine learning scenarios and execution of AI-based applications, these solutions are based on ARM architecture.
Amazon Trainium2 – This is a custom-designed AI accelerator chip built by Amazon specifically for training large machine learning models, particularly core models (FM) and large language models (LLM) with trillions of parameters. Trainium2 stands out for accelerating the training process of these complex models.
Graviton4 is a powerful CPU architecture designed by Amazon specifically for its cloud services and can benefit Amazon Bedrock in several ways:
• Improved cost-effectiveness: Graviton4 processors offer a better price-performance ratio compared to previous generations. This means that running generative AI applications on Amazon Bedrock models powered by Graviton4 could potentially be more cost-effective.
• Possible performance gains for specific tasks: While Graviton4 is not designed specifically for AI training like Trainium2, some generative AI tasks within Amazon Bedrock applications could benefit from its performance improvements. This could include tasks that rely heavily on general computing power rather than specialized AI acceleration.
• Trainium2 delivers up to 50% training cost savings over comparable Amazon EC2 instances and is designed for machine learning workloads. Trainium2 was built to train and deploy ultra-large Generative AI models with hundreds of miles of millions of parameters.
In short, Generative AI fits into companies' existing and future business and operating models, as well as productively experimenting with Generative AI use cases. The combination of scalable cloud computing power, foundational AI models, and AWS's ongoing commitment to technical excellence offers businesses and developers an exceptional platform to drive project creativity, efficiency, and innovation. of companies, generating long-term opportunities resulting from innovative trends. This is how Amazon Bedrock can develop wide margins of creation and deployments in large projects through Generative AI.
AI Agents at Amazon Bedrock
AI agents in Amazon Bedrock are crucial for the following reasons:
They accelerate the development of generative AI applications:
• They allow you to create generative AI applications without the need for complex coding, saving time and resources.
• Users can create agents simply by describing their goals in natural language, Amazon Bedrock takes care of the orchestration and execution.
They expand the capabilities of generative AI:
• Agents can connect to enterprise systems and data sources, allowing them to access and process real-world information.
• This allows them to perform more complex tasks and generate more precise and personalized responses.
Improve efficiency and productivity:
• Agents can automate tasks previously performed by humans, freeing up time for humans to focus on more strategic activities.
• They can also improve task accuracy and consistency, reducing errors and rework.
They promote innovation:
• By making it easy to build generative AI applications, Bedrock empowers businesses to explore new ideas and solutions.
• This can lead to the development of new products, services and business models.
Amazon Bedrock and its AI agents are catalysts for business innovation, offering a path to efficiency, personalization and intelligent decision making, driving growth and success in today's technology-driven world.
